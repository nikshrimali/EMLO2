<b>Assignment-03</b>

1. Add "per step logging" (training step), and log "hp_metric" in tensorboard as validation loss

- Please refer to https://github.com/atulgupta01/EMLO/tree/main/Assignment03

2. Do a Hyperparam sweep for CIFAR10 dataset with resnet18 from timm

- Please refer to https://github.com/atulgupta01/EMLO/blob/main/Assignment03/optimization_results.yaml

3. Push model, logs and data to google drive (using dvc)

- Please refer to - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10MdcuWKsfDLtQPp1UeNJsrQLf3KL8hER?usp=sharing


4. Push the pytorch lightning - hydra template with the dvc changes that we made to github

- Please refer to https://github.com/atulgupta01/EMLO/tree/main/Assignment03

Jupyter Notebook

- Same file is uploaded in github location as well. Path - https://github.com/atulgupta01/EMLO/blob/main/Assignment03/EMLO_Assignmen03.ipynb

** Please note that I did not create pipeline for DVC. Rather I did those things manually in jupyter notebook.**

5. Upload Tensorboard logs to (https://tensorboard.dev/) and share link to the tensorboard.dev
